         Steps for selecting the venue :
         <li class="u u1">Define the event requirements: The first step is to determine the requirements of the event.
            What type of event is it? How many people will attend? What is the budget? These questions will help to
            determine the type of venue needed.</li>

         <li class="u">Research potential venues: The next step is to research potential venues that meet the event
            requirements. This can be done through online searches, recommendations from colleagues, or by working 
            with an event management company.</li>

         <li class="u"> Visit potential venues: After creating a shortlist of potential venues, it is essential to 
            visit each one to assess its suitability. During the visit, ask questions about the venue's amenities, 
            capacity, and any restrictions.</li>

         <li class="u"> Evaluate costs: It is important to evaluate the cost of each venue and compare them to the 
            event budget. Negotiate the price if possible to get the best deal.</li>

         <li class="u"> Review contracts: Before signing a contract, review it carefully. Make sure that it includes 
            all the agreed-upon terms, such as the rental fee, cancellation policy, and any additional fees.</li>

         <li class="u">Book the venue: Once a suitable venue has been found, it is time to book it. Make sure to 
            confirm the date and time, and pay any required deposit to secure the venue.</li>
